This is a weather API project. It basically demonstrates the usage of API calls and how to get data from external server using `https.get()` method. It is one of the projects from the web dev course I took, aalthough it only had the API calling part and now I'm thinking to improve by adding some CSS and React in future. Right now, it just has weather description and icon showing on the HTML page when user inputs their city name and country code(like "IN" for India).
